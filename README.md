# Covid-19-WebPage

A dummy project to improve my skills on HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JS/JQuery. The goal is by using an API develop a web site that shows statistics of Covid-19 pandemic. There are two versions presented in here. One with selection parameters are presented in a navbar, and one within the page. "Navbar version" seems to be not very compatible with mobile devices. There is a known bug that occurs when it comes to retrieving the information of countries with special characters and such, to be fixed in the future.
